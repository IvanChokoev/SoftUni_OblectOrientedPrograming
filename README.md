# SoftUni_OblectOrientedPrograming

This Repository is for my homework/tests from the SoftUni course on Object Oriented Programing using C#
In this course, we were shown the basic principles of OOP as well as classes, objects, methods and attributes.

The four main principles:
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

All of the tasks have inside them the problem that needs to be solved.
